mslcompiler
===========

Coursework from Aston University Programming Language Implementation course 1995.

As part of one of our courses, we wrote a "compiler" that had to parse the grammar for a high level language, do lexical analysis etc and "compile" the program into a set of "machine code" instructions that another program could run.  It was also meant to identify syntax errors.

The code is in Modula-2 (.DEF and .MOD files), with sample programs along with their output in .TXT files.  Find out more about Modula-2 at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2

This was written as part of my BSc Computing Science degree, I found if the other day and thought I would put it on here for amusement.

Strangely enough, one of the first things I had to do in my first job after graduating was produce something similar in the C language using Bison and Flex (Compiler compiler tools) for a LISP like language.
